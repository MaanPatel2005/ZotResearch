# ZotResearch
ZotResearch is an application that allows for a streamlined method of accessing research opportunities at UC Irvine. Specifically, it allows for professors to easily create opportunity postings for students using a simplified posting system. When a user/student applies for a position, the professor can directly view the profile of the students, instead of having to create an entire application process. On the students' end, the application provides a simple applying system, by allowing users to apply for opportunities with a single click. Whenever a user applies for an opportunity, their profile will automatically be available to the user who posted it.\
